# wasteBinManagement
A sensor attached to a waste-bin will constantly transmit data about the status of different parameter levels. Thresholds can be set for these parameters. If the threshold is surpassed, it triggers the creation of a service request in the connected system (SAP Hybris).  Additionally, a predictive service is connected to the application, which enables to analyze and predict the time and probability of future events which enables predictive planning.
